    <h1 id="about">About Plinth</h1>
    <p>Plinth is an open source <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_synthesizer">modular synthesis</a> system that runs in your web browser. It currently consists of a <a href="rack.html">demo page</a> that lets you load and patch a set of sample modules (aka <em>blocks</em>), and a <a href="https://github.com/rsimmons/plinth">draft spec</a> of a module API.</p>

    <h2>Quick Start</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Drag blocks from the block palette on the left into the rack area on the right. <em>(currently, blocks can't be rearranged after being placed)</em>
      <li>Press the Flip button (or space bar) to show the back view of the rack.
      <li>In the back view, click or drag block ports to connect wires between them.
      <li>To remove wires, toggle Delete Wires mode and click on them.
      <li>Click on any block in the palette for help.
      <li>To hear something, connect an audio generating block (such as Waverly) to the Rack Outputs block audio port.
      <li>Unwanted blocks can be deleted with the small X button in the back view.
